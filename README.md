# Med-Tracker

Copyright (c) 2019 Allison Wong

This will be an ASP.NET Core Slack app to help track medication usage.  I take medications for migraines, but I should only be taking a certain number per week.  This app will ping me each day, collecting and storing information about medication usage in a SQLite database.   

## Planned Features

Slash commands to:
- Initialize tracking.  The app will then start pinging daily
- Retrieve weekly medication use
- Retrieve a monthly output log along with statistics
- Cease tracking
